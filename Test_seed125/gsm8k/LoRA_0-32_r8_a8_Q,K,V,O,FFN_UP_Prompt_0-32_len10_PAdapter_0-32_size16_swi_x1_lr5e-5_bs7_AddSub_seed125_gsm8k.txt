{"generate": "\nA: In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. That means in the second set he retrieved twice as many balls as in the third set. We can write this as 2x = 19. We can solve this equation to get x = 9.5. Since we can't retrieve half a ball, we round this down to 9. So in the first set he retrieved 9 + 4 = 13 balls. The answer is 13.### Answer:13.0", "output": "\nA: He retrieved 19 balls in total. He retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set. That means in the second set he retrieved 19 - 4 = 15 balls.

We can now use the equation 19 = 4 + 15 + 7 to solve for the number of balls in the first set. 19 = 4 + 15 + 7, so 4 = 19 - 15 - 7, so 4 = -3. This is not possible, so the answer is not 19. We can use the equation 19 = 4 + 15 - 7 to solve for the number of balls in the first set. 19 = 4 + 15 - 7, so 4 = 19 - 15 + 7, so 4 = 21.

That means 3 * 6 = 18 pieces of straw are used for the rats. There are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. That means 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw are used for the hamsters. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits. That means 20 pieces of straw are used for the rabbits. In total 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 pieces of straw have been used for the small rodents. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. That means 160 - 88 = 72 pieces of straw are left. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, 72 pieces of straw must be divided by 6. That means 72 / 6 = 12 rats.

That leaves 25 - 8 = 17 inches for the sterling silver beads. Each bead is 1/4 inch long, so 17 * 4 = 68 beads are needed. The answer is 68.### Answer:68.0", "output": "\nA: Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. We can calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones by multiplying 8 (the number of gemstones) by 1 (the length of each gemstone). This gives us 8 * 1 = 8 inches. We can then subtract this from the total length of the necklace (25 inches) to get the total length of the sterling silver beads. This gives us 25 - 8 = 17 inches. We can then divide this by one-quarter of an inch (the length of each sterling silver bead) to get the number of beads. This gives us 17 / 0.25 = 68 beads.

That means the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph must be 300/50 = 6. The answer is 6.### Answer:", "output": "\nA: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
